Trouble he will find you
No matter where you go
Oh oh
No matter if you're fast
No matter if you're slow
Oh oh

The eye of the storm
Or the cry in the morn
Oh oh
You're fine for a while
But you start to lose control

He's there in the dark
He's there in my heart
He waits in the wings
He's gotta play a part
Trouble is a friend
Yeah trouble is a friend of mine

Trouble is a friend
But trouble is a foe
Oh oh
And no matter what I feed him
He always seems to grow
Oh oh

He sees what I see
And he knows what I know
Oh oh
So don't forget
As you ease on down the road

He's there in the dark
He's there in my heart
He waits in the wings
He's gotta play a part
Trouble is a friend
Yeah trouble is a friend of mine

Trouble is a friend
But trouble is a foe
Oh oh
And no matter what I feed him
He always seems to grow
Oh oh

He sees what I see
And he knows what I know
Oh oh
So don't forget
As you ease on down the road

He's there in the dark
He's there in my heart
He waits in the wings
He's gotta play a part
Trouble is a friend
Yeah trouble is a friend of mine

So don't be alarmed
If he takes you by the arm
I won't let him win
But I'm a sucker for his charm
Trouble is a friend
Yeah trouble is a friend of mine
